## Datsme | A friend finder app

#### Datsme is a startup based in NSIT that aims to build a mobile app that helps people connect with others of similar mindset, to help people go out of their homes and discover other people, and find friends in them.

I'm collaborating directly with the co-founders and Psychologist of their team to build a responsive explanatory website from scratch, as a Web Development Intern.
